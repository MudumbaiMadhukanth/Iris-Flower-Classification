🌸 Iris Flower Classification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It uses the famous Iris dataset available in scikit-learn.

📌 Project Overview
Explored the dataset with pandas and seaborn visualizations.
Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using scikit-learn.
Evaluated performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Achieved ~97% accuracy on test data.
Created a prediction pipeline for new input samples.

📊 Results
The KNN classifier achieved high accuracy (~97%).
Confusion matrix and classification report confirmed reliable predictions.
Visualization showed clear separation among species.
